# The action fetches code from the PR's source branch, takes the target branch, and
# tries to fetch and apply patches using PR's target branch.
# Example: if a PR targets a version branch `3.20`, the action would checkout to `3.20`
# branch in the patches repo and try to apply patches from that branch. If patches
# apply, the action succeeds, otherwise it returns an error, and indicates that patches
# need to be adjusted.
#
# - Action runs on all branches.
# - Action runs only when label is applied: `check patches` (will be changed to all PRs
# when workflow is more tested).
